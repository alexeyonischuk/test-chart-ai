### **Coppock Curve Overview**

The **Coppock Curve** is a momentum-based technical analysis tool developed by economist Edwin Coppock. It is designed to identify long-term buying opportunities in the stock market by measuring the rate of change (RoC) of a security's price. The curve is primarily used for identifying bottoms in major markets and is applied to indices rather than individual stocks.

### **Study Purpose and Calculation**

The Coppock Curve combines two Rate of Change (RoC) periods (short-term and long-term) and then smooths the result using a weighted moving average. This smoothing helps identify longer-term trends, particularly in detecting buy signals after significant downtrends.

#### Key Elements:
- **Short RoC**: Measures the rate of change over a shorter time period.
- **Long RoC**: Measures the rate of change over a longer time period.
- **Weighted Moving Average**: The combined RoC values are smoothed using a weighted moving average to highlight long-term market trends.

### **Inputs**:
- **Period**: (Number) Defines the length of time over which the weighted moving average is calculated.
- **Field**: (String) Specifies which price data field to use for the calculation (e.g., "Close").
- **Short RoC**: (Number) The number of periods used to calculate the short-term rate of change (default: 11).
- **Long RoC**: (Number) The number of periods used to calculate the long-term rate of change (default: 14).

### **Outputs**:
- **Result**: (Number) The smoothed Coppock Curve value, which can be plotted on a chart to identify potential buy signals.

### **Study Calculation Process**:
1. **Rate of Change Calculation**: The short-term and long-term RoC are computed based on the specified periods.
2. **Smoothing**: A weighted moving average is applied to the sum of the two RoC values.
3. **Result Interpretation**: A rising Coppock Curve is interpreted as a buy signal, especially after a prolonged market downturn.

### **Study Libraries Required**:
- **chartiq.js**: Core charting library.
- **standard/studies.js**: Essential for study calculations.

### **Warnings and Best Practices**:
- **Activation**: Ensure that the "studies" feature is activated before using the Coppock Curve.
- **Warning**: Avoid modifying the core library files directly. If changes are needed, create a separate file to extend or override functionalities.

### **Code Example**:


import { CIQ as _CIQ } from "../../../js/chartiq.js";
import "../../../js/standard/studies.js";


let __js_advanced_studies_coppock_ = (_exports) => {

/* global _CIQ, _timezoneJS, _SplinePlotter */


var CIQ = typeof _CIQ !== "undefined" ? _CIQ : _exports.CIQ;

if (!CIQ.Studies) {
	console.error("coppock feature requires first activating studies feature.");
} else {
	CIQ.Studies.calculateCoppock = function (stx, sd) {
		var quotes = sd.chart.scrubbed;
		var field = sd.inputs.Field;
		if (!field || field == "field") field = "Close";

		var longDays = parseInt(sd.inputs["Long RoC"], 10);
		if (!longDays) longDays = 14;
		var shortDays = parseInt(sd.inputs["Short RoC"], 10);
		if (!shortDays) shortDays = 11;
		var period = sd.days;
		if (!period) period = 10;
		if (longDays < shortDays) return;

		if (quotes.length < Math.max(shortDays, longDays, period) + 1) {
			sd.error = true;
			return;
		}
		for (var i = Math.max(sd.startFrom, longDays); i < quotes.length; i++) {
			var denom1 = CIQ.Studies.getQuoteFieldValue(quotes[i - shortDays], field);
			var denom2 = CIQ.Studies.getQuoteFieldValue(quotes[i - longDays], field);
			if (denom1 && denom2) {
				// skip if denominator is 0 --
				quotes[i]["_Sum " + sd.name] =
					100 *
					(CIQ.Studies.getQuoteFieldValue(quotes[i], field) / denom1 +
						CIQ.Studies.getQuoteFieldValue(quotes[i], field) / denom2 -
						2);
			}
		}

		CIQ.Studies.MA("weighted", period, "_Sum " + sd.name, 0, "Result", stx, sd);
	};

	CIQ.Studies.studyLibrary = CIQ.extend(CIQ.Studies.studyLibrary, {
		Coppock: {
			name: "Coppock Curve",
			calculateFN: CIQ.Studies.calculateCoppock,
			inputs: { Period: 10, Field: "field", "Short RoC": 11, "Long RoC": 14 }
		}
	});
}
