### **Disparity Index Study Overview**

The **Disparity Index** is a technical indicator used to assess the degree of divergence between an asset's price and a moving average. This index highlights the percentage difference between the price of a security and a selected moving average, indicating whether the price is overbought or oversold in relation to its historical trend.

### **Study Purpose and Calculation**

The **Disparity Index** measures the percentage difference between the current price of a security and a moving average over a specified period. Traders use this indicator to gauge whether a security's price is extended beyond typical levels in either direction and to identify potential reversal points or trends.

#### Key Elements:
- **Disparity Index**: Represents the percentage deviation of the price from the selected moving average.
- **Moving Average**: The indicator uses a moving average, which can be of different types (e.g., simple, exponential), to calculate the disparity.
- **Price Field**: Typically, the closing price is used to compute the disparity index, but other fields like open, high, or low can also be selected.

### **Inputs**:
- **Period**: (Number) Defines the number of periods used to calculate the moving average.
- **Field**: (String) Specifies the price field used for calculation, typically the "Close" price.
- **Moving Average Type**: (String) Specifies the type of moving average used (e.g., simple moving average).

### **Outputs**:
- **Result**: The calculated Disparity Index value, representing the percentage difference between the price and the moving average.

### **Study Calculation Process**:
1. **Moving Average Calculation**: A moving average is calculated based on the selected field (e.g., "Close" price) and period.
2. **Disparity Calculation**: The percentage difference between the current price and the moving average is computed as follows:
   \[
   \text{Disparity Index} = \left( \frac{\text{Current Price}}{\text{Moving Average}} - 1 \right) \times 100
   \]
3. **Result**: The result is displayed as a percentage, allowing traders to identify price deviations from the moving average.

### **Study Libraries Required**:
- **chartiq.js**: Core charting library.
- **standard/studies.js**: Provides essential functionalities for study calculations.

### **Warnings and Best Practices**:
- **Activation**: Ensure the "studies" feature is activated before using the Disparity Index.
- **Note**: Modifications to the core library files should be avoided. Create separate files to maintain compatibility with future updates.

### **Code Example**:


import { CIQ as _CIQ } from "../../../js/chartiq.js";
import "../../../js/standard/studies.js";


let __js_advanced_studies_disparity_ = (_exports) => {

/* global _CIQ, _timezoneJS, _SplinePlotter */


var CIQ = typeof _CIQ !== "undefined" ? _CIQ : _exports.CIQ;

if (!CIQ.Studies) {
	console.error("disparity feature requires first activating studies feature.");
} else {
	CIQ.Studies.calculateDisparity = function (stx, sd) {
		var quotes = sd.chart.scrubbed;
		if (quotes.length < sd.days + 1) {
			sd.error = true;
			return;
		}
		var field = sd.inputs.Field;
		if (!field || field == "field") field = "Close";

		CIQ.Studies.MA(
			sd.inputs["Moving Average Type"],
			sd.days,
			field,
			0,
			"_MA",
			stx,
			sd
		);
		for (var i = Math.max(sd.startFrom, sd.days - 1); i < quotes.length; i++) {
			if (!quotes[i]) continue;
			var qMA = quotes[i]["_MA " + sd.name];
			if (qMA)
				quotes[i]["Result " + sd.name] =
					100 * (CIQ.Studies.getQuoteFieldValue(quotes[i], field) / qMA - 1);
		}
	};

	CIQ.Studies.studyLibrary = CIQ.extend(CIQ.Studies.studyLibrary, {
		Disparity: {
			name: "Disparity Index",
			calculateFN: CIQ.Studies.calculateDisparity,
			inputs: { Period: 14, Field: "field", "Moving Average Type": "ma" }
		}
	});
}
