### **Ease of Movement Study Overview**

The **Ease of Movement (EOM)** indicator is a volume-based oscillator used in technical analysis to assess the relationship between price changes and trading volume. It reflects how easily prices move in a specific direction, indicating the strength of a price move relative to the volume involved.

### **Study Purpose and Calculation**

The **Ease of Movement** indicator evaluates the efficiency of price movements by comparing the rate of price change with volume. A high EOM value suggests that price is advancing easily with minimal volume, indicating strength, while a low or negative value may indicate weakness or difficulty in price movement.

#### Key Elements:
- **Ease of Movement**: Measures how easily prices move relative to volume.
- **Moving Average**: The EOM is typically smoothed using a moving average to reduce noise and provide a clearer trend.
- **Price Field**: Typically, the high and low prices are used in calculating the average price for EOM.

### **Inputs**:
- **Period**: (Number) Defines the number of periods used to calculate the moving average for smoothing the Ease of Movement indicator.
- **Moving Average Type**: (String) Specifies the type of moving average used (e.g., simple moving average).

### **Outputs**:
- **Result**: The calculated Ease of Movement value for each period, smoothed by the moving average.

### **Study Calculation Process**:
1. **Price Range Calculation**: The midpoint of the high and low prices is calculated for both the current and previous period. The difference between these two values gives the price movement (denoted as `dm`).
2. **Volume Adjustment**: The price movement is divided by the volume adjusted for a normalization factor (usually 100,000,000) and the range between the high and low prices (denoted as `br`).
3. **Ease of Movement Formula**:
   \[
   \text{Ease of Movement} = \frac{\text{Price Movement}}{\text{Volume Normalization Factor}}
   \]
4. **Smoothing**: The result is smoothed using the selected moving average type and period to create the final Ease of Movement values.

### **Study Libraries Required**:
- **chartiq.js**: Core charting library.
- **standard/studies.js**: Provides essential functionalities for study calculations.

### **Warnings and Best Practices**:
- **Activation**: Ensure the "studies" feature is activated before using the Ease of Movement indicator.
- **Note**: Avoid modifying the core library files directly. Create separate files for any necessary customizations.

### **Code Example**:

import { CIQ as _CIQ } from "../../../js/chartiq.js";
import "../../../js/standard/studies.js";


let __js_advanced_studies_easeOfMovement_ = (_exports) => {

/* global _CIQ, _timezoneJS, _SplinePlotter */


var CIQ = typeof _CIQ !== "undefined" ? _CIQ : _exports.CIQ;

if (!CIQ.Studies) {
	console.error(
		"easeOfMovement feature requires first activating studies feature."
	);
} else {
	CIQ.Studies.calculateEaseOfMovement = function (stx, sd) {
		var quotes = sd.chart.scrubbed;
		if (quotes.length < sd.days) {
			sd.error = true;
			return;
		}
		for (var i = Math.max(1, sd.startFrom); i < quotes.length; i++) {
			var avgCurrent = (quotes[i].High + quotes[i].Low) / 2;
			var avgPrior = (quotes[i - 1].High + quotes[i - 1].Low) / 2;
			var dm = avgCurrent - avgPrior;
			var br = quotes[i].Volume / 100000000 / (quotes[i].High - quotes[i].Low);
			var result = dm / br;
			if (!isFinite(result)) quotes[i]["_EOM1 " + sd.name] = NaN;
			//With NaN, the study plotter will plot from the previous point
			//directly to the next point after the current tick. Infinity was making the
			//study not plot in the panel at all while the data point was in dataSegement.
			else quotes[i]["_EOM1 " + sd.name] = result;
		}
		CIQ.Studies.MA(
			sd.inputs["Moving Average Type"],
			sd.days,
			"_EOM1 " + sd.name,
			0,
			"Result",
			stx,
			sd
		);
	};

	CIQ.Studies.studyLibrary = CIQ.extend(CIQ.Studies.studyLibrary, {
		EOM: {
			name: "Ease of Movement",
			calculateFN: CIQ.Studies.calculateEaseOfMovement,
			inputs: { Period: 14, "Moving Average Type": "ma" }
		}
	});
}
